* Map

This package defines the map, terrains, improvements and resources of MaW.

** Manually written

*** map_glbl.h

Contains declarations and typedefs which should be part of the external
interface, but which are also used internally. These are the most basic
typedefs, such as ~maw_tile~, ~maw_pos~ and ~maw_coord~.

*** map_ext.h

Functions which should be part of the external interface, but not used
internally, such as ~get_total_food(maw_tile)~ and ~init_map()~. Basically, this
file should contain the functional interface to the package, while map_glbl.h
contains the datatypes.

*** map_ext.cpp

Implementations of the functions in =map_ext.h=. Also contains the vectors with
the different terrains, resources etc. Basically, this file implements the
external interface to the map package, hiding all the unpleasant details.
   
*** terr.h

The base class for terrains. 

*** imprv.h

The base class for improvements.

*** resc.h

The base class for resources.

** Autogenerated

*** map_glbl_gen.h

Contains the autogenerated enums for the classes and also declarations of the
bitfield accessor functions. These are part of the external interface of the package.

*** map_glbl_gen.cpp

Implementations of the bitfield accessor functions declared in =map_glbl_gen.h=.

*** map_int_gen.hpp

Contains all the class definitions of all the different subclasses of ~terr~,
~resc~ and ~imprv~. That is, all the different terrains, resources and
improvements in the game. Also contains functions to initialize vectors of these
classes.
